                <h1>What is a Fastball?</h1>
                <p>The fastball is the most common pitch thrown in baseball. It is the fastest straightest pitch that a human can throw, and it is intended to have little or no movement when thrown. The pitchers rely purely on the speed and velocity of the throw to prevent the ball from being hit. The average speed of a fastball thrown by a major league player is around 85-100 mph.</p>

            <div data-role="collapsible">
                <h1>Why does it not move or drop?</h1>
                <p>The back spin of the ball thrown creates differentials in the air flow on each side of the ball (high pressure at the bottom of the ball and low pressure at the top of the ball) causing the ball to go towards the lower pressure zone, this is known as the Magnus effect. The seams of the baseball also help to stabilize the ball's flight path while it is spinning in the air.</p>

                <h1>What is a Curveball??</h1>
                <p>The curveball is a pitch that has forward spin or top spin causing the ball to dive or drop in a downward path. Another name for the curveball is "12-6" it refers to the top to bottom movement (picture a clock with hands at 12 and 6). The average speed of a curveball thrown by a major league player is around 70-80 mph.</p>

                <h1>What is a Homerun?</h1>
                <p>A Homerun is a hit that allows the batter to reach all the bases and returning home without stopping earning the batter's team a run or point. This is most commonly done by hitting the ball over the outfield fence, and it is very rare for a batter to make a complete trip around the bases and back home for a homerun if the ball did not go over the outfield fence. </p>
            </div>

            <div data-role="collapsible">
                <h1>How do you hit a Homerun?</h1>
                <p>There are three (3) very important factors when hitting the baseball for a homerun. Swing speed, angle of the hit, and contact with the ball at the bat's "sweet spot".</p>
                <p>The fast you swing the fat the further it will go, for every extra 1 mph of swing speed the ball will go 5 feet further.</p>
                <p>The best angle to hit the ball is at a 30 degree angle making contact just below the ball's equator.</p>
                <p>The "sweet spot" of the baseball bat is located approximately 5-7 inches from the end of the barrel. This is considered the "sweet spot" because when the bat makes contact with the ball at that area it causes the least amount of vibration, this is important because when there is vibration the bat recoils and because of the that recoil energy is lost causing the ball to not go very far. </p>
